1- Name = class, Verb = fucntion
2- USE CAMELCASE ALWAYS{
    A Class starts with capital : User is the class instance
    An object always starts with lowerCase : user then it is an object of the user class
    File names always start with lowerCase
    
    A word with a suffix ex: log-in the "in" will not be uppercase because its not a noun or a Verb 
}
You should always use Descriptive names 

Don't add un-needed spaces

Any schema file should be imported with the class name example User not UserDb

Failing to comply with teamConventions makes you vulnerable to getting your code thrown
